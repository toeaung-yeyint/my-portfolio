					<p>
						Hi, I'm Toe Aung Ye Yint, a front-end developer with a diverse
						educational background who is driven and skilled. I have a Master in
						Information Technology in addition to my Bachelor of Architecture,
						which gives me a distinctive perspective on design and aesthetics.
						With expertise in both Architecture and Information Technology, I am
						equipped to create compelling user interfaces that captivate and
						delight users.
					</p>
					<p class="hidden paragraphToHide">
						In addition to my educational background, I have gained valuable
						work experience, most notably, at the Monash University, Faculty of
						Engineering (August 17, 2022 - current) as an Online Content
						Officer, where I collaborated with cross-functional teams to enhance
						the user experience and engagement on the university's website.
						Through my front-end development skills, I played a pivotal role in
						integrating content, design, and functionality to create an
						immersive digital experience for users.
					</p>
					<p class="hidden paragraphToHide">
						Lastly, but certainly not least, my area of expertise is in
						utilising JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to convert design principles
						into functional and responsive interfaces. I excel in creating
						clean, efficient, and maintainable code that adheres to industry
						best practices. As a dedicated front-end developer, I am committed
						to staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and emerging
						technologies.
